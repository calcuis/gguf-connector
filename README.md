## GGUF Connector

GGUF (GPT-Generated Unified Format) is a successor of GGML (GPT-Generated Model Language), it was released on August 21, 2023; by the way, GPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer.

This package is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application that uses the ctransformers or llama.cpp to interact with a chat model for generating responses.

Install the connector via pip (once only):
```
pip install gguf-connector
```

Include the connector by:

```
import gguf_connector 
```

Pull any (pre-trained model) GGUF file(s) along with the Python code and it will automatically be detected by the module.
